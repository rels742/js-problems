# Plain English Solution
// I need to find out how to get a function to recognise if a number is a multiple of something. -- Something to do with the modulo %

// Up to 1000 max!!! so this function probably has to include a loop to iterate and check all numbers up to 1000

// then add on those numbers as long as it recognises its a multiple of 3 or 5.

// Return the final sum.
