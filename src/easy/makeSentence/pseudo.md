# Pseudo Code Solution
outside of funtion create a VARIABLE for the rest of the sentence eg: sentenceOne = "testing to see if this works"

THEN 

FUNCTION fullSentence(start, sentence) 
    DECLARE A VARIABLE OF firstWord = that takes the first letter of the sentence of the firstWord TO UPPER CASE AT INDEX 0 and SLICE the rest of the words from INDEX 1

    then the RETURN for the specifc sentence would be: sentence = sentenceOne or SentenceTwo ect

    RETURN firstWord + SPACE + sentence + SPACE + "."
 

then finally CONSOLE LOG fullSentence('hello', sentenceOne))
