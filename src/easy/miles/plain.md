# Plain English Solution
// I need to convert km to m
// find out how many miles in 1km (0.621371miles)
// use that formula inside my function, giving my function a paramater of num (being the km we're converting)
// formula would be num * 0.621371
// look for a js funcition that rounds numbers to the nereast integer.
