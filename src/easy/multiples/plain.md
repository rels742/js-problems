# Plain English Solution
// Create a function that takes two parameters. 
// The multiple. The length of the array.
// In the function, 
// will need two variables in the function. One to store the array 
// one that will be set to 1 (x * 1)
// a for loop that will iterate through that variable until it reaches the second paramater (the length) 
// eg length is 5 so in the function var blah = 1 so will start off with x*1 and iterate until it does x*5
// as we are generating an array of multiples we will need to return that array length, pushed as the last step
