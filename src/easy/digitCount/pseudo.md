# Pseudo Code Solution
FUNCTION getLength(number) {
return the number either as a number or string 
//OR IS THERE A WAY TO CONVERT THE NUMBER AS A NUMBER OBJECT TO A STRING AND RETURN THE LENGTH???)
//RETURN its length
}

//Finally CALL the FUNCTION  to test 
eg.
console.log(getLength(100));

//Should return 3
