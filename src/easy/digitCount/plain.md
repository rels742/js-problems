# Plain English Solution
// The problem wants me to be able to take a number of any length and show/return the length of the number in the numerical digit. For example 24 = 2 , 1000 = 4 , 3256000 = 7.

// I think I would need to create a let with a value...

// To get this to work I would create a function with paramater of number. (and maybe the number needs to be represented as a string)

// Inside the body of that function, I would tell it to take the arguement (number) and iterate through its string for its length amount and the return the length...
